# abundances

Some notes about the abundance data in this folder
- `_asp` files use abundances that are re-calculated with [Asplund et al. (2009)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ARA%26A..47..481A/abstract) solar abundances. These are the preferred versions
- `gjoll.tab` is a combined version of the individual `GjollNN.tab` files
